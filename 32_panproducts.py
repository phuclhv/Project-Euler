We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

1st Approach: Brute force with Math
Assume that a < b and a*b = product is pandigital
We have 2 * 5000 = 10000 > 9 total digits and 100 * 100 = 10000 > 9 total digits
Thus a and b would be limit in range (2,100) and (100,5000) respectively with a < b
